# Datos-Ani: Farm Managementment System - Java Swing and Java AWT with SQL 


## A simple and optimized farm management system - Datos-Ani - utilizing both Java Swing and Java AWT, connecting it with SQL and having a one-tier architecture database model.


This is a project that aims to tie the bridge between technology and agriculture by helping farmers manage and keep track of the harvest and economic performance of their farms, and crop rotation. This project is possible by utilizing Java NetBeans and SQL. The detailed features of the application are as follows:

• Harvest and economic performance, the application will curate or organize the inputted data by the farmers to be concrete and easily understood information. This will allow the farmers to easily assess the performance of their harvest and its economic performance. 

* Crop Planting Date

* Crop Harvest Date

* Crop Sales

* Crop Costs

* Crop Profits

     
• Tracking the crop rotation, it allows farmers to keep track of the crops planted on a specific patch or piece of land and keep track of the harvested crop before it can be planted again on the very soil it was harvested. 


• Find Function to easily find a specific crop or season to be assessed, or it can be both.


• Visual Representation of harvest and economic, and crop rotation per season by using bar graphs.


• One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication using email addresses for securing sensitive data by utilizing JavaMail API.
