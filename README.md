# Datos-Ani: Farm Managementment System - Java Swing and Java AWT with SQL 


## A simple and optimized farm management system - Datos-Ani - utilizing both Java Swing and Java AWT, connecting it with SQL and having a one-tier architecture database model.


This is a project that aims to tie the bridge between technology and agriculture by helping farmers manage and keep track of the harvest and economic performance of their farms, and crop rotation. This project is possible by utilizing Java NetBeans and SQL. The detailed features of the application are as follows:

• Harvest and economic performance, the application will curate or organize the inputted data by the farmers to be concrete and easily understood information. This will allow the farmers to easily assess the performance of their harvest and its economic performance. 

* Crop Planting Date

* Crop Harvest Date

* Crop Sales

* Crop Costs

* Crop Profits

     
• Tracking the crop rotation, it allows farmers to keep track of the crops planted on a specific patch or piece of land and keep track of the harvested crop before it can be planted again on the very soil it was harvested. 


• Find Function to easily find a specific crop or season to be assessed, or it can be both.


• Visual Representation of harvest and economic, and crop rotation per season by using bar graphs.


• One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication using email addresses for securing sensitive data by utilizing JavaMail API.

### How to Install? - For End Users



To make the application up and running follow these instructions:

1. Download this repository as a zip file. 
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Install MySQL Community Version or any SQL system software. I recommend using MySQL: [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
4. Open the 'Database (SQL Queries)' folder and open every file there to execute all the queries. In order to setup a database.
5. Open the 'DatosAni.jar' file. 




### How to Install? - For Developers


For the developers who want to make some changes, contribution or use the source code of the project.

Follow these instructions:

1. Download this repository as a zip file. 
2. Extract the zip file.
3. I assume that you have any SQL system software already. However, if you don't have one - Download MySQL: [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
4. Open the 'Database (SQL Queries)' folder and open every file there to execute all the queries. In order to setup a database.
   
     If you want to make changes to the database or use it. Here's the ER Diagram for its logic:

   ![Entity-Relationship (ER) Model - Datos-Ani](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8340ab2-8161-4d11-bda6-e86cd4e2f404)

5. Open any IDE dedicated for Java. Either [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb120/nb120/).
6. Add each library in the 'lib' folder to the library class of your project.
7. Run it. 


### Known Issues (In Development)

If you notice there are additional java files and templates also tables in the database that pertains to scheduling of crops planting, crops harvesting, and crop rotation that didn't made the final cut. It's a feature that I haven't been able to add yet or let's just say, not ready to add yet as I am still thinking for ways to implement it better. However, it is already optimized and runnable, you can add it to the system if you want to try it. I need some time to think for other ways to approach the scheduling feature. 

In addition, it still lacks the appropriate user feature but we already have a plan for it. 

Here's the UI design created by Chrisfel Mae Fortunado for it: 

![User Info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/369a855c-813c-48b6-b933-ee39f16fffd3)

These two (2) features are coming soon.
